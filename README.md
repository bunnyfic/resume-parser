## How It Works

1. User uploads one or more resume PDFs
2. The system:
   - Extracts text using layout parsing and OCR (if needed)
   - Cleans noisy OCR text
   - Detects name using hybrid NLP + rule-based logic
   - Extracts email and phone using robust regex handling
3. All results are compiled into a single table
4. User downloads the final Excel file

## Running Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
